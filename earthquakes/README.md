##Notes
here are some features I added in this project
####auto complete input
    Human friendly typing helps you better find your location.
#####dynamic populated markers 
    Earthquakes are found after user operates done, etc, drag map, change places, zoom in/out.
####clean all markers
    Too many markers? No worries, they are one-click-away. 
####Top 10 largest earthquakes for the past 12 months.
    Apparently there are no up-to-date data [geoName webservice](http://www.geonames.org/export/JSON-webservices.html#earthquakesJSON)
